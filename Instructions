The Iot home automation requiures few basic idea about relays, arduino, Networking and using of assitants like Alexa and Google Assistance.
The Things that are needed are :-
    1. NodeMCU.
    2. Relay module
    3. Blynk Application
    4. IFTTT bridge
    5. Alexa or Google Assistant.
NodeMCU is over Iot development board which is going to recieve and do the work with relay.
As you may know that Google assistant and Alexa cannot be used directly , so we need a bridge between NodeMCU and Our assistant
this bridge is IFTTT, which is a web-based service that allows users to connect between web services so that, when something happens with one service, a trigger goes off and an action takes place automatically on the other
there is one more thing needed to accomplish the task that is Blynk,
Blynk connects the NodeMCU with the Internet and give a path location for IFTTT
Blynk is a mobile application, thus can be used sololy and with combation of other services as well.
